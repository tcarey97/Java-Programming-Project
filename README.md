# Java-Programming-Project

This is my final project for the graduate subject, Programming and Software Development (https://handbook.unimelb.edu.au/2023/subjects/comp90041). 
This subject developed my knowledge of object-oriented programming and we were tasked with designing, implementing and testing a range of projects in the Java programming language.
I completed this subject with an overall score of 92, finishing with an H1 - High Class Honours.

For this project, we needed to design and implement a virtual HR assistant software that allows applicants to submit their applications, which are then algorithmically analysed and 
matched to available open positions. The software selects those applications worth taking a second look at by the HR team for the next stage of the application process. 
This is done using my unique matchmaking algorithm which is applied to all avaliable jobs and their applicants. Depending on the user role inputted in the command-line arguements when the program is run, 
whether that be 'hr' (for HR team), 'applicant' (for job applicants) or 'audit' (for an audit of the matchmaking algorithm), the software launches a different interface (i.e. main menu) and offers a range of different functionalities.  
For example, a member of the HR team can access applicant profiles and create new job listings using the HR Assistant Software. An applicant, on the other hand, can create a new profile and apply to available jobs in the Application Portal. 
If audit is inputted, comprehensive statistics are displayed to the user, revealing inherent biases that may be built-in as an (un)intended consequence of the matchmaking algorithm. 

This project included an oral exam, requiring students to explain the rationale of their code and also where potential improvements could be made.

I hope this project can help reveal some of my proficiency in Java. Please contact me if you would like more information in regards to this project.
